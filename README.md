# Computer Science Book Recommend  
I read all of them cover to cover, and think these book are brilliant.   
very easy to understand, very good for self-taught people. very friendly for beginner.  
not advance topic that need a lot prerequisites.  
the order doesn't matter here, you shouldn't read these book one by one as how I list them.  



### 1. Grokking Algorithms An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people
[Data structure and Algorithm]    
https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230  
Very easy to understand, a lot of cartoon drawing , example and analogy.  
This book use Python. about 200 page, I finally understand how BFS work.  


### 2. But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone
[Hardware]  
https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers/dp/0615303765     
Great book about how "logic gate" combine together and work,
how add two binary number, how computer "remember" a bit,    
how combine these thing that can "remember" bit into memory.  etc,   
this book is more Computer Science than Electrical engineering, 
by that, I mean it's not talk about how these hardware are actually made in realy word, 
what process and machine and cost to make a transister, the history of electricity, etc.
It focus on these essential concept, that is logic gate.



#### Topic this book didn't cover 
this book only cover essential topic to help you understand how computer work,   
So I am not blame author here, I just list what topic this book didn't says.    

* how computer represent negative number like -3
* how computer represent dicimal number like 6.78
