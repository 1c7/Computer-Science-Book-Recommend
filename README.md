# Computer Science Book Recommend  
I read all of them cover to cover, and think these book are brilliant  


### 1. Grokking Algorithms An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people
[Data structure and Algorithm]    
https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230  
Very easy to understand, a lot of cartoon drawing , example and analogy.  
This book use Python. about 200 page, I finally understand how BFS work.  


### 2. But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computers for Everyone
[Hardware]  
https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers/dp/0615303765     
Great book about how "logic gate" combine together and work,
how add two binary number  
#### Topic this book didn't cover 
this book only cover essential topic to understand how computer work,   
So I am not blame author here  
I just think reader know this before read the book would be better  
* how computer represent negative number like -3
* how computer represent dicimal number like 6.78
